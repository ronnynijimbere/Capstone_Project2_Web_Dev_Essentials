        <h3>Company Profile</h3>
        <p>The Umbilo Mail has named Ronny Nijimbere as one the young upcoming enterpreneurs to watched out for in 2019. Fruit and Veg World was established in 2017 and is the talk all around Durban for its affordable and sometimes ridiculous low prices.</p>
        <p>After completing his MBA in Business Management in 2016, Ronny worked for 6 months as a business consultant for First National Bank (FNB) before deciding to open his own business. He got a business loan with FNB and he managed to open up SFruit and Veg World in October 2017.</p>
        <p>Ronny started working as the manager with the help of co-manager Mark Stevens for the store and he only had a cashier (Kerry Reid) and a cleaner (Nandi Mazibuko). The main focus is to provide affordable prices to our customers in Umbilo and the surrounding suburbs. Due to our success, we managed to purchase an 8 ton truck and we do deliveries to our customers. We also deliver to our customers homes for those who purchase online for R3000 or more in Durban.</p>
